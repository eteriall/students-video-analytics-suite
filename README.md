# Students Video Analytics Suite (SVAS)

**Students Video Analytics Suite (SVAS)** is a research-oriented toolset developed by **Copernicus Berlin e.V.** for analyzing group behavior and participant engagement during Erasmus+ training courses.
It uses computer vision to interpret classroom or seminar video data, helping facilitators understand participants’ attention, collaboration, and emotional background throughout the learning process.

## Overview

SVAS provides structured, privacy-respecting video analytics designed for educational and training environments.
All data processing takes place within the organization’s secure infrastructure, and no personal information or images are transmitted to external servers or third parties.

The suite operates entirely **within the device and organizational network boundary**:

* Images and videos are stored **only on offline or local devices**.
* Analysis and annotation are performed **locally**.
* No external cloud or remote APIs are used.

## Core Applications

1. **Photobank Annotation**
   Detects and labels participants in training course photos, allowing users to quickly find pictures of themselves in Copernicus Berlin’s internal or public photobank.

2. **Attention Index Measurement**
   Calculates a participant’s attention level based on their visible engagement during a session — comparing total presence time with moments of distraction (e.g., phone or laptop use while others remain attentive).

3. **Group Dynamics Analysis**
   Identifies seating and grouping patterns to understand social tendencies — who participants prefer to sit with, and which individuals tend to avoid each other.

4. **Attendance and Punctuality Tracking**
   Records the time of first and last visual detection during lectures to determine arrival delays and overall presence duration.

5. **Emotional Background Estimation**
   Interprets visible emotional states throughout the training period to provide facilitators with a nuanced understanding of participants’ comfort and engagement.

## Ethical and Data Protection Standards
The generated insights are made available **exclusively to project facilitators** to support participant guidance, improve group cohesion, and strengthen the educational impact of Erasmus+ activities.
SVAS is designed in full compliance with the **data protection principles of Copernicus Berlin e.V.** and **GDPR** requirements:

* No data is sent or stored externally.
* All media remains within the secure organizational environment.
* Processing is performed solely for research and educational improvement.
